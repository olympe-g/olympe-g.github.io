							<h4 class="card-title my-name wine">Wine</h4>
							<p class="card-text">Wine (from Latin vinum) is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally Vitis vinifera, or a hybrid with Vitis labrusca or Vitis rupestris. Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients.[1] Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. There are also wines made from fermenting other fruits or cereals, whose names often specify their base. Wines made from plants other than grapes include rice wine and various fruit wines such as those made from plums or cherries. Some well known examples are hard cider from apples, perry from pears, pomegranate wine, and elderberry wine. Wine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest known traces of wine from Georgia (Caucasus) in Eurasia where 8000-year-old wine jars were found and in Iran with 7,000-year-old wine jars.[5][6] The earliest known winery is the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery Armenia. Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects, which are evident after the normal serving size of five ounces.</p>
